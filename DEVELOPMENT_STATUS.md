## üîÑ PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED

### AI Chat ‚Üí Database Pipeline
**Status**: Built but **NEVER TESTED END-TO-END**
- [x] Chat interface with basketball-specific commands
- [x] Intent parsing ("create shooting workout", "add exercises", etc.)
- [x] AI workout generation via Claude API
- [x] Workout persistence API (`/api/workouts`)
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: End-to-end testing of chat ‚Üí AI ‚Üí database flow

### User Progress Tracking
**Status**: Database tables exist, no connected functionality
- [x] Database schema for progress tracking
- [x] Biometric data storage structure
- [ ] Progress calculation and analytics
- [ ] UI components for progress visualization
- [ ] Connection to wearable data

### Exercise Management
**Status**: Intent parsing exists, no database operations
- [x] Chat commands for adding exercises
- [ ] Exercise creation and modification APIs
- [ ] Exercise library management
- [ ] Custom exercise creation

## ‚ùå NOT STARTED

### Wearable Device Integration
- [ ] Apple Health API integration
- [ ] Google Fit API integration
- [ ] Fitbit/Garmin device sync
- [ ] Real-time heart rate monitoring
- [ ] Movement analysis from sensor data
- [ ] Automatic workout detection

### Real-time Workout Tracking
- [ ] Start/stop workout sessions
- [ ] Live performance metrics
- [ ] Real-time coaching feedback
- [ ] Workout session analytics
- [ ] Performance comparison over time

### Social Features (Marked "Under Construction")
- [ ] User connections and friends
- [ ] Activity feed implementation
- [ ] Achievement system activation
- [ ] Leaderboards and challenges
- [ ] Sharing workout results

### Authentication System
**Status**: Currently bypassed for development
- [ ] User registration and login
- [ ] Profile management
- [ ] Session management
- [ ] Password reset functionality

## üö® CRITICAL ISSUES REQUIRING IMMEDIATE ATTENTION

### 1. End-to-End Testing Gap
**Priority**: URGENT
- AI chat ‚Üí workout creation ‚Üí database save pipeline has NEVER been tested
- Unknown if database CRUD operations actually work
- Unknown if AI API integration functions properly

### 2. Database Function Verification
**Priority**: HIGH
- `createWorkout()` function exists but never tested
- `storage.getWorkouts()` import path may be incorrect
- Database persistence may fail silently

### 3. API Route Validation
**Priority**: HIGH
- `/api/ai/generate-workout` - never tested with real requests
- `/api/workouts` POST/GET - built but not validated
- Error handling and edge cases not tested

## üìã IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

### Phase 1: Core Validation (Week 1)
1. **Test AI Chat Pipeline**
   - Start clean dev server
   - Test "create shooting workout" command in AI chat
   - Verify workout appears in database
   - Test workout retrieval and display

2. **Validate Database Operations**
   - Test all CRUD operations manually
   - Verify data persistence
   - Check error handling

3. **API Endpoint Testing**
   - Test all workout-related endpoints
   - Validate request/response formats
   - Test error scenarios

### Phase 2: Wearable Integration (Week 2-3)
1. **Apple Health Integration**
   - Implement HealthKit API
   - Heart rate and activity data sync
   - Workout detection and classification

2. **Real-time Data Processing**
   - Process incoming wearable data
   - Store in biometric_data table
   - Calculate performance metrics

### Phase 3: Enhanced Features (Week 4+)
1. **Real-time Workout Tracking**
2. **Advanced Progress Analytics**
3. **Social Features Activation**
4. **User Authentication Implementation**

## üîß TECHNICAL DEBT

### Code Quality Issues
- Multiple unused API files from old structure
- Import path inconsistencies
- Missing error handling in several components
- No comprehensive testing strategy

### Performance Concerns
- No caching strategy for AI API calls
- Database query optimization needed
- Bundle size optimization required

### Security Issues
- Authentication completely disabled
- No input validation on API endpoints
- Database credentials in environment files

## üóÇÔ∏è FILE STRUCTURE STATUS

### ‚úÖ Migrated Successfully
- `/src/app/` - Next.js 15 App Router structure
- `/src/components/` - React components with TypeScript
- `/src/lib/` - Utility functions and database setup
- `package.json` - Updated dependencies for Next.js 15

### üóëÔ∏è Cleanup Required
- `/client/` directory - Old React+Vite files (should be deleted)
- Old API route files in `/api/` (should be cleaned up)
- Legacy configuration files

## üìä TESTING STATUS

### Never Tested
- [ ] AI chat workflow end-to-end
- [ ] Database CRUD operations
- [ ] Workout creation and retrieval
- [ ] API endpoint functionality
- [ ] Error handling scenarios

### Partially Tested
- [x] Page loading (dashboard, AI coach)
- [x] Database connection
- [x] Next.js app compilation

### Fully Tested
- [x] Development server startup
- [x] Database schema and table existence
- [x] Component rendering without errors
